THOUGHTS ABOUT BUILDINGPLANS

Buildingplans are for making big multiblock structures with one type of block that is
instance of BlockStruct -> BlockContainer. The Multiblock will have to adapt to it's new
form. The Buildingplans wont handle that kind of advancment. The Buildingplans will set
the masterblock.

A buildingplan is a BasePlan and contains only a array and is 5x5x5.

- Player creates EntityBuilder with sertent modifiers that makes it know what to create.
- Player places EntityBuilder on ground and right clicks on it.
- EntityBuilder is removed and replaced with a BlockCocoon(Master) and TileEntityCocoon that both gets the
  infromation needed for the building and the genetics of the builder. Information = BuildPlan & Building to go there.
- The Cocoon fills the BuildPlan space with BlockCocoons with diffrent metadata all pointing to the masterblock.
  If it has the biomass for it.
- After filling there will go some time.
- Cocoon replaces every block it has placed with requierd buildingblocks. 

BasePlan contains...
A priority array in what order the cocoon blocks should be placed and how the building will look.

TileEntityBaseStructure... (?)
Replaces all the cocoon TileEntitys and Blocks with it own block.

* - BaseArrays.AnyArray -> BasePlan

EntityBuilder - Genetics, BasePlan, BlockStruct /Master -> TileEntityCocoon
TileEntityCocoon - Genetics /Master -> TileEntityBaseStructure
